# Immunolog
Human T-cell Immunology code repository

This repo contains code and plots from a variety of different projects and datasets.
Raw data will not be published as it is proprietary.

However, this repo may still be interesting in case you wish to
* look at scripts to run Seurat, scanpy, TCR repertoire analysis, SingleR, celltypist, snpclust, cellranger, etc.
* need a list of marker genes and genesets which are often used in immunology
* need links to find public datasets

Some of the code in this repository is a part of the following publications and thus these have their own, seperate repository as well:
1. Human TH17 cells engage gasdermin E pores to release IL-1α on NLRP3 inflammasome activation (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01386-w)
2. Sodium chloride in the tumor microenvironment enhances T-cell metabolic fitness and cytotoxicity (\<yet to be published\>)
3. T-Cell Receptor Repertoire Analysis with Computational Tools—An Immunologist’s Perspective (https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/12/3582)
