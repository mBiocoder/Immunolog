# Immunolog
Human T-cell Immunology code repository

This repo contains code and plots from a variety of different projects and datasets.
Raw data not published as it is proprietary.

However, this repo may still be interesting in case you wish to
* look at scripts to run Seurat, scanpy, TCR repertoire analysis, SingleR, celltypist, snpclust, cellranger, etc.
* need a list of marker genes and genesets which are often used in immunology
* need links to find public datasets
